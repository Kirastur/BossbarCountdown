# Welcome to the BossbarCountdown configuration settings
#
# - The configuration is not simple, so please read the documentation first
# -
# - Please see our Github Wiki for Documentation
# -      https://github.com/Kirastur/BossbarCountdown/wiki
# -
# - For support you can contact us at discord.
# -      A link to discord can be found on the Github Wiki
# -
# - For a quick test do the following (assuming your player is called "player1"):
# -   1.  enter "/bbcd start demo player1
# - As a result you see a Bossbar counting down
# - If the left border is reached, a brodcast is sent to all players
#
#
# Remember: 
#     The speed is the progress for each tick
#     A tick is 1/20 of a second
